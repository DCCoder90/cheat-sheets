## ‚ú® Dev Cheat Sheet Repository ‚ú®
Welcome, fellow coder, programmers, nerds, and anyone in between!
Are you constantly jumping between languages, tools, and configurations? Do you ever find yourself thinking, "Wait, how do I do that for_each loop in HCL again?" or "What's the Go short declaration operator?"

Fear not! This repository is your personal utility belt, packed with quick-reference "cheat sheets" to supercharge your daily coding adventures. Each sheet is designed to be concise, and immediately useful!

These are actually my personal cheat sheets that I usually keep stored in Obsidian but I figured I'd make them available to the rest of you!  And of course if you have a sheet of your own that you'd like to contribute feel free to!
